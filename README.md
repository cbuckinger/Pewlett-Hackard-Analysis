# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the client company, Pewlett-Hackard, with information for a staffing plan to address upcoming retirements. P-H’s approach considers both vacancies and strategies for addressing them, including creating a mentorship program for positioning replacements within the company, as well as preparing for external recruitment.  A critical outcome of this effort was creation of a cohesive, structured SQL database for its large and complex Human Resources function, previously maintained in separate files in Excel. 
Analysis
The analysis focused on organizing and modifying the existing Excel-based files structure into an SQL database with key connections between the files. Once accomplished, the queries returned new tables with information on:
•	The number of near-term potential retirements by department;
•	The identity and number of employees overall who are retirement-eligible, based on date of birth; and
•	The identity and number of employees eligible for the mentorship program, based on hire date;
Results
The important features from the developed query method are as follows: 
•	 Of the approximately 300,000 employees cataloged in the employees table, about 72,500 are eligible for retirement in the near-term.  That’s equal to about 24% of the work force.
•	The majority of the retirement-eligible employees are in senior technical or senior staff positions.  These two groups constitute 70% of total retirement-eligible staff.
•	Approximately 1,500 employees could be considered for the mentorship program.
•	Of those employees eligible for mentoring, 44% are in engineering or senior engineering positions.
Summary
In the near-term, a significant portion of Pewlett-Hackard’s work-force could be depleted due to retirement.  In the summary above, that number (72,500) computes to a little less than one out of every four workers.  P-H as a tech-heavy employer will likely need sufficient recruitment lead-times to ensure a qualified candidate base to meet its needs.  While there are employees in place who could move into senior positions, that number is very small, about 5% of forecasted need.   
Pewlett-Hackard has two major points to cover to maintain current staffing levels.  One, it must create and execute a plan for immediate replacement recruitment; and two, it must focus efforts on attracting and retaining qualified young talent.  
This analysis did not investigate the impact on individual departments.  This would be an important piece to help fill in the gaps and focus recruitment efforts.  To facilitate recruiting younger employees, P-H should look at its trends in past hiring practices, particularly in recent efforts; that is, hiring counts by date over the last ten years.  
This analysis serves as a starting point for an in-depth review and possible modification of its HR component.  Using the database structure achieved in this analysis would be the foundation for further review of departmental and organization-wide business models and inform the process of creating staffing models to meet P-H’s evolving needs.  This information system is flexible and can be adapted to accommodate change in the organization.
